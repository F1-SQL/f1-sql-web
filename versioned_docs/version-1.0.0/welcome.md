Welcome to Sequel Formula, this project has been created using Formula One data from [Ergast API](http://ergast.com/mrd) primarily with some of our own additions added in to enhance the [design](querying-the-database/database-schema). 

In this project you will find everything you need to get a copy of Sequel Formula up and running on your own [supported](about/supported-versions) instance of Microsoft SQL Server.

If you would like to find out how the database is created, you can do so [here](about/database-creation), or if you are looking for more information on the table structure, we have a [schema diagram](querying-the-database/database-schema) and [table overview](tables) which should help you get started.

If you have any questions, you can ask them over in the discussions section of the GitHub repository and we will be happy to help.
