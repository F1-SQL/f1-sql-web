The developer of the Ergast API announced at the end of the 2023 season that the API would be winding down, there would be support through the 2024 season but once that had concluded the API would be deprecated, this left F1 SQL with a job to do, we had to source a new data source that had all the data points we require for our database and then amend all of our build tooling to get the new database built before the start of the 2025 season.

We are pleased to announce that we have managed to source new data sources and the tooling that allows us to build F1 SQL has been re-written to use the new data source. 

If you are using database backups from pre-2025 you will need to make sure you are using the version 1.0 documentation, the version 2.0 documentation is non transferable and does not apply to the new database schema. 

Any questions or issues can be raised on the GitHub repo as usual and we will do our best to get back to you as soon as possible. 

Thanks for your continued support 
Team F1 SQL
