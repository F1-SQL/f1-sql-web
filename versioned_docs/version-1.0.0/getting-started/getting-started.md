# Getting Started

### Downloading the Latest Release

The easiest way to get started is to download the latest release from GitHub [here](https://github.com/f1-sql/f1-sql/releases) and restore one of the available backups to your instance. 

You can find out if your version of SQL Server is supported by F1 SQL [here](../about/supported-versions)

### Restoring the database

### Next Steps

Now that you have the database restored to your instance of SQL Server, lets have a look at the database diagram.
